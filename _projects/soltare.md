I developed and designed this website for Soltare Inc. I built it with HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP.
The website contains a [demo](https://soltare.com/demo.html) of Soltare's main product, iHear. I built this using 
Pixi.js to create the graphics. I learned about JavaScript promises when working on the sound features.
