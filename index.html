<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm a full-stack software developer from Edmonton, Alberta. I have been developing software professionally
for the past 5 years. My expertise is in the development of performant and extendable Web and mobile applications.
I'm a Linux enthusiast. I use linux professionally to develop server side applications and at home as a desktop OS.
I enjoy writing software of all kinds, so I've dabbled on embedded systems development with Arduino and desktop application
development.
</p>

<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p>
    I use HTML, CSS, and React.js or Vue.js to develop pleasant and responsive web applications.
    I enjoy developing graphics programs for the Web using Canvas and WebGL.
</p>

<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>
    I use Python with Django and C# with ASP.NET Core to develop REST APIs. I have used many protocols such as
    gRPC, Websockets, MQTT to develop applications. I have a lot of experience using Postgres, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ
    for storing and caching data. I use Kubernetes for applications that need the resilience of a cluster and zero
    downtime deployments and docker compose with managed databases for everything else.
</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>C, Bash scripting, processes, threads, mutex, semaphores, pipes and sockets.</p>

<h3>DevOps</h3>
<p>
    Terraform for provisioning infrastructure. Ansible for configuring infrastructure.
    I can automate anything with tools such as Terraform, Ansible, Azure CLI.
    Bash. GitHub Actions and Azure Devops.
